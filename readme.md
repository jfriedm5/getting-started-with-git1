This is the readme file for thinkful lesson module 11 lesson 4. 
Please note on thinkful lesson 11.3 git basics, when they say make sure readme file box is cleared when creating a new remote repo, they mean unchecked.
If  you have uncommited changes to the local repo you cannot push it to remote repo. All changes much be committed. 
also on 11.4 when you are creating and then pushing this readme.md file, ensure that when you stage the file you match the file name you created. Their instruction says to create readme.md and then to git add README.md which will result in an error, dont do this!
